    "# Player Statistics Scraping\n",

    "There are a couple of possible data sources for NBA data. The easiest to scrape is basketball-reference.com, but there are multiple issues with their data. The first issue, in my opinion, is they use estimated possessions to calculate their per-possession statistics, whereas NBA.com stats are calculated with actual possession counts. Secondly, nba.com has more statistics, including tracking statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of NBA.com is that it is not an HTML website. It is completely dynamic, meaning I need to use Selenium to scrape the content. \n",
