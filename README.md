- Feature Notebooks
    -  Initial Team Features
    -  More Team Features
    -  Feature notebooks 2c and 2d are hidden for IP privacy, for a couple of algorithms I developed years ago. I would be happy to describe the metrics in general though. They are all trying to answer the question, 'for each posession, how much does a player add or take away from a team, considering offense and defense equally?'
