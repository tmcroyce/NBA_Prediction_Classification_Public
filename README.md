# NBA Machine Learning Prediction (Classification) for Team Wins

![Basketball](images/ball.png)

# Intro
This repository contains much more than just the Machine Learning Prediction Classification Files, as it also contains all of the ancilary applications built off of the data that underpins the prediction. With that being said, here are the necessary scraping and prediction files:

    -  Feature notebooks 2c and 2d are hidden for IP privacy, for a couple of algorithms I developed years ago. I would be happy to describe the metrics in general though. They are all trying to answer the question, 'for each posession, how much does a player add or take away from a team, considering offense and defense equally?' I will try to provide more clarity in the future.
